# Task Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive task management capabilities for the client perception survey application, fulfilling the user's request for the ability to "add/change/delete tasks, and the ability to hide tasks for a specific client."

## Features Implemented

### 1. Task Management Interface (AdminDashboard)
- **New Tab**: Added "Task Management" tab in the admin dashboard
- **Password Protection**: Maintains existing admin123 password protection
- **Tab Navigation**: Clean tabbed interface for different admin functions

### 2. CRUD Operations for Activities
- **Add Activities**: Create new survey activities with:
  - Category selection (4 pillars)
  - Activity name and description
  - Auto-generated unique IDs
- **Edit Activities**: Inline editing of existing activities
- **Delete Activities**: Remove activities with confirmation
- **Reset to Defaults**: Restore original 80 activities

### 3. Client-Specific Visibility Controls
- **New Tab**: Added "Client Visibility" tab in admin dashboard
- **Client Selection**: Dropdown to select specific clients
- **Activity Management**: Show/hide specific activities for selected clients
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for hidden/visible activities
- **Pillar Organization**: Activities grouped by category for easy management

### 4. Database Schema Updates
Enhanced the Supabase schema with new tables:

#### `custom_activities` Table
- Stores custom/modified activities
- Fields: id, pillar, pillar_name, name, description, timestamps
- Replaces static activities when customizations exist

#### `client_activity_visibility` Table  
- Controls activity visibility per client
- Fields: client_id, activity_id, is_hidden, timestamps
- Unique constraint per client-activity pair

### 5. Dynamic Activity Loading
- **Hybrid Approach**: Uses custom activities if available, falls back to defaults
- **Client Filtering**: Automatically filters activities based on visibility settings
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately in the survey interface

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created/Modified
1. **TaskManager.tsx**: Complete CRUD interface for activities
2. **ClientVisibilityManager.tsx**: Client-specific visibility controls
3. **AdminDashboard.tsx**: Enhanced with new tabs and functionality
4. **App.tsx**: Updated to use dynamic activities and visibility filtering

### Key Functions
- **loadCustomActivities()**: Fetches custom activities from database
- **loadVisibilitySettings()**: Filters activities based on client visibility
- **toggleActivityVisibility()**: Show/hide activities for specific clients
- **saveToDatabase()**: Persists activity changes to Supabase

### Database Integration
- **Supabase Integration**: Full CRUD operations with proper error handling
- **Fallback Support**: Works with localStorage when Supabase unavailable
- **Row Level Security**: Proper RLS policies for public survey access
